# LoRa – The Saviour  
*A Low-Cost Emergency Communication System Using ESP32 and LoRa*  

## Overview  
**LoRa – The Saviour** is a handheld device that enables **offline text messaging** between smartphones using a **Bluetooth-to-LoRa relay**. Designed for **trekkers, campers, and disaster-stricken areas**, this device provides a **reliable, low-power alternative to satellite messengers** when no cellular or Wi-Fi network is available.  

We have published a research paper on this project in the **IJRPR Journal**, contributing to advancements in **wireless communication** and **IoT technologies**.
